Getting Started
---------------

To get started with PAC-man, you'll need to get
familiar with [Git and Repo](http://source.android.com/source/using-repo.html).

To initialize your local repository using the PAC-man trees, use a command like this:

    repo init -u git://github.com/theapant/android-pac.git -b cm-10.1

To sync up:

    repo sync

Then to build:

    ./build-pac.sh ancora_tmo       *for Galaxy Exhibit 4g
    ./build-pac.sh ancora           *for Galaxy Wonder
